# Statistical Computation Web App

A lightweight, client-side web application for performing common statistical calculations. This tool provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to quickly compute metrics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and linear regression without needing a backend server.

## Features

-   **Data Input**: Easily add or delete a set of numbers from a text area.
-   **Measures of Central Tendency**:
    -   Calculate the **Mean** (Average).
    -   Calculate the **Median** (the middle value of a sorted dataset).
    -   Calculate the **Mode** (the most frequently occurring value).
-   **Measures of Dispersion**:
    -   Calculate the **Standard Deviation**.
    -   Calculate the **Variance**.
-   **Statistical Moments**:
    -   Calculate the **First Order Moment** (which is the Mean).
-   **Predictive Analysis**:
    -   Calculate the **Linear Regression** line (`y = a + bx`) between two datasets of equal length.

## Live Demo

To run this project, you don't need a web server. Simply download the files and open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).



## How to Use

1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  **Enter Data**: In the first text area, enter your numbers separated by commas (e.g., `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`).
3.  **Load Data**: Click the **"1. Add Numbers"** button to load your data into the application.
4.  **Perform Calculation**: Click any of the calculation buttons (e.g., "Calculate Mean", "Calculate Median") to see the result.
5.  **For Regression**:
    -   Enter your first dataset in the top text area.
    -   Enter your second dataset (of the same size) in the second text area.
    -   Click **"9. Calculate Regression"**.
6.  **Clear Data**: Click the **"2. Delete Numbers"** button to clear the current dataset and start over.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

-   `index.html`: This file provides the basic structure and user interface for the application, including the input areas, buttons, and result display.
-   `script.js`: This file contains all the client-side logic. It handles data input, performs all statistical calculations, and manipulates the DOM to display the results.
-   `styles.css` (not provided): This file would contain the CSS rules for styling the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Functionality Overview

-   **`getData()`**: Reads the comma-separated values from the input field, converts them into an array of numbers, and stores them in a global `nums` variable.
-   **`deleteData()`**: Clears the `nums` array.
-   **`calculateMean()`**: Computes the arithmetic average of the numbers.
-   **`calculateMedian()`**: Sorts the array and finds the middle value. It correctly handles both even and odd-sized datasets.
-   **`calculateMode()`**: Determines the most frequently occurring number in the dataset.
-   **`calculateStandardDeviation()`**: Calculates the standard deviation, a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of the dataset.
-   **`calculateVariance()`**: Calculates the variance from the mean.
-   **`calculateRegression()`**: Takes two datasets and computes the slope (`b`) and intercept (`a`) of the simple linear regression line.
-   **`displayResult(text)`**: A helper function that updates the UI to show the final calculation result.

## Future Improvements

This project serves as a great foundation. Future enhancements could include:

-   **Improved Error Handling**: Add validation for non-numeric or improperly formatted input.
-   **Data Visualization**: Use a library like Chart.js or D3.js to create histograms, box plots, or scatter plots for the regression data.
-   **More Statistical Functions**: Implement additional calculations such as percentiles, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis.
-   **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the layout and styling for a more modern look and feel.
-   **File Input**: Allow users to upload data from a `.csv` or `.txt` file.
